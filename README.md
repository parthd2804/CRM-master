# Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to support structured management of customer data, interactions, and operational workflows. The system emphasizes database-driven design and reliable backend logic to ensure data consistency and usability.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how well-designed database systems can support business operations and decision making.

## Problem Context
Organizations often struggle to manage customer information across multiple processes such as enrollment, interaction tracking, and relationship management. Without a centralized and structured system, data becomes fragmented, leading to inefficiencies and poor decision support.

This project addresses that challenge by modeling a CRM system that organizes customer-related data into a structured, queryable, and scalable backend.

## System Design & Approach
- Designed relational database schemas to model customers and related entities
- Implemented SQL and PL/SQL logic to manage core system operations
- Ensured data integrity through constraints and procedural logic
- Focused on backend reliability rather than UI-driven features
- Structured workflows to reflect real-world operational scenarios

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL  
- PL/SQL  
- Relational database design  
- Backend system logic

## Key Capabilities
- Centralized storage of customer information
- Structured handling of customer records and relationships
- Backend logic to support operational workflows
- Query-ready data model to support reporting and analysis

## Notes & Future Improvements
- Add reporting and analytics features for customer insights
- Extend the schema to support more advanced CRM use cases
- Integrate a frontend interface for improved usability
